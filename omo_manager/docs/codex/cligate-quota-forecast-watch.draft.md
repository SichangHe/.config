# Draft: CLI-Gate quota forecast watcher manager guide

Status: draft only. This guide is not governing manager policy until the human explicitly approves it.

Scope: use this only for notifications from the experimental CLI-Gate quota forecast watcher. Do not use it to infer quota from historical task records, and do not reopen closed quota implementation tasks.

## What the watcher measures

- Window: one or two hours of recent CLI-Gate receipt velocity.
- Forecast: current receipt velocity projected to the provider reset time.
- Target: theoretical token pace to expiry, with the desired actual pace between 70% and 95%.
- Notification: only `too_fast` and `too_slow` should notify the main manager.
- Suppression: same-signal notifications are debounced for at least one hour.

The watcher is unavailable when reset time, remaining-token estimate, or receipt velocity is not comparable enough. In that case, do not invent a pace decision.

## Manager response

For `too_fast`:

- Slow discretionary token-heavy experiments through their existing owners.
- Preserve essential work, human-owned panes, production safety work, and already-authorized critical operations.
- Do not create broad new coordination lanes just to pause work.
- Ask owners for scoped slowdowns or checkpoints instead of killing sessions blindly.

For `too_slow`:

- Pull forward useful deferred work through existing owners.
- Prefer bounded, already-planned tasks over exploratory bulk work.
- Keep paid, browser-mutating, or credential-sensitive work behind its normal approval and safety checks.
- Recheck quota after a major task completes or after the forecast materially changes.

For `on_track`:

- No manager action is required.

For `unavailable`:

- Use the normal quota summary/help output and its reliability metadata.
- Preserve capacity for important work until comparable target and velocity inputs exist.

## Approval boundary

This draft can be cited in an implementation status email as the proposed manager guide. It must not be treated as persistent operating policy or copied into `MANAGER.md` without explicit human approval.
